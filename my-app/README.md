# Modern Development with React: React Portfolio

Now that i've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for my first portfolio site, as well as create or update other materials so that you can showcase my skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React sets us apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## Required Components
At a minimum, my portfolio must render these 6 components:  
* App
* Header
* Home page
* Projects page
* Project (on Projects page)
* Contact page

## Base Requirements
My portfolio had to meet the following requirements and use the following technologies:

* React
* Navigation using React Router, dynamic rendering, or another third part router

The portfolio must contain the following information:

* Name
* Links to GitHub profile, LinkedIn page, Email address, Phone number (optional), CV (in PDF format)
* A list of projects (Challenges or Projects). For each project, make sure you have the following: Project title, Link to the deployed version, Link to the GitHub repository. 
* Screenshot of the deployed application.



## Useful commands to run in the project directory
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
